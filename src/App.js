// Tarea secci√≥n 4:

// Add Filter component which allows us to use a dropdown and set a filter
// Listen to changes on the dropdown
// Whenever the user does select a new state (a new year) you should listen to that event and then make sure that the picked year (value) is forwarded to the Expenses component
// Add the ExpenseFilter component to Expenses.js (wrap Card with a div and include ExpenseFilter at the beggining)
// Forward the picked year from ExpenseFilter to the Expenses component and then in the Expenses component store it in a state.
// No need to filter the expenses yet, just listen the change event and forward the data.
